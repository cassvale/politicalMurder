Chapter 1: Introduction

This is an independent research project  

This research explores the Right to Life, focusing on political murder as its greatest threat and proposing countermeasures. The context is a future post-communist China undergoing transition.  

Currently, discussions about the potential collapse of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are widespread but hushed, while mainstream voices remain silent. This pattern has precedents.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, private discussions about China’s economic downturn were common, yet mainstream media insisted that China’s economy would surpass the United States—debating only the timing. Then, in 2023, the narrative shifted abruptly, with widespread reports on China’s economic struggles, all simultaneously.  

A similar pattern occurred with the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, a handful of independent thinkers warned of its possible collapse, but their predictions were dismissed. When Soviet republics declared independence, governments and institutions feigned surprise, masking their failure to anticipate the event.  

The cautious stance of institutions is understandable—false predictions damage credibility and risk retaliation from the Communist Party. In the 1990s, many wrongly predicted the CCP’s imminent fall, only to be proven wrong. Yet, ignoring the possibility of collapse altogether is equally dangerous,  as the consequences would be global.  

When the Soviet Union fell, the West intervened in Russia’s transition, designing new political and economic structures. But today, it is clear this transition failed. Within a decade, Vladimir Putin legally rose to power, then paralyzed the system from within, securing lifelong rule. In 2022, he launched a war reminiscent of 20th-century barbarism.  

Russia’s failed transition is widely acknowledged, but there is little agreement on why it failed. Meanwhile, history risks repeating itself. If the CCP collapse, the world may intervene once again without a clear strategy, potentially paving the way for a Chinese version of Putin and ushering in a new era of  22nd-century autocratic warfare.  

The Right to Life in Historical Context  

This research examines Russia’s failed transition and China’s potential future transition through the lens of the Right to Life—the most fundamental human right. 

While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was formally introduced in 1948, its roots stretch back to Ancient Greece. Solon’s reforms in Athens (circa 594 BCE) abolished debt slavery, marking the earliest universal legal protection for the life of citizens—essentially the first legal rights. 

Rights, by definition, are what the law universally protects. Today, legal rights are abundant, but as we look back in history, the list shrinks. Stripping it down to its core, we arrive at Solon’s protection of life. Beyond this singular moment in the tiny city-state of Athens, the world remained governed by the principle of sacrificing a few for the greater good.

Solonism was like a meteor—a sudden flash of brilliance in a city-state no larger than a speck on the map, blazing with the intensity of a star. It shattered the norms of its time, laying the foundation for the Athenian democracy, which later stood against the Persian Empire at its peak. Yet, 200 years later, it vanished as abruptly as it had appeared, as if it had never existed. 

A thousand years passed before it hesitantly resurfaced in Europe through legal frameworks like habeas corpus. In medieval England, habeas corpus offered limited protection—only for the nobility. It was not until the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 that this right was extended to ordinary English citizens, though still excluding many, such as those in the colonies. 

Legal rights took firm root in the West only in the 19th century, eventually evolving into universal human rights in 1948.

Solonism emerged in the 6th century BCE, but it only became truly relevant in modern times. It had been lost for a millennium before the West began reviving it—a process that took another thousand years. Resistance was naturally stronger in regions unaffected by Greek heritage. 

Human rights may be embraced in the West today, but elsewhere, many states likely ratified human rights treaties under Western pressure, all while remaining confident they could undermine them. A fundamental weakness of the human rights system is its equal treatment of all rights. In reality, rights exist in a hierarchy. Prioritizing non-essential rights can dilute the most fundamental ones. In fact, a significant portion of the modern human rights was promoted by the Soviet Union precisely to blur this hierarchy and weaken enforcement.

Political Murder as Governance

In regions untouched by Greek heritage—which, for most of history, meant nearly the entire world—political murder evolved into a systematic tool of governance. 

Political murder refers to state-sanctioned killings carried out openly to instill fear and enforce obedience. While many associate this primarily with mass killings like the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, or Myanmar’s massacres, its scope extends far beyond. 

The primary aim of political murder is not merely to eliminate victims but to ensure the submission of the living. A highly developed system of political murder, for example, might compel families to beg for the public execution of their own relatives, turning death into a spectacle of control.

Massacres are the heavy weapon of political murder, indispensable for establishing a reign of terror, but they come with chaos that destabilizes the system. Mao Zedong, a master of political murder, expertly balanced massacres with more controlled purges. While the Cultural Revolution saw mass killings, political purges, spaced out over several years, were used more controlled, deaths in the hundreds of thousands rather than tens of millions, allowing him to achieve the desired effect while seamlessly integrating into the normal functioning of the system.

In such regimes, political murder is not an aberration but a central part of governance, embedded in the bureaucracy. The death penalty, for example, turns open killings into bureaucratic routine. In modern times, this structure hides political murder behind the shield of national sovereignty and law enforcement, allowing repression to continue under the guise of legitimacy. Billions of people still live under such regimes.

The Right to Life Above Sovereignty

Putin concealed his political murders behind broader human rights violations. As long as systematic political murder persisted, he ensured control, rendering human rights accusations ineffective. This research proposes countermeasures by elevating the Right to Life as the highest legal priority.

In a post-communist China, the millennia-old tradition of a unified China may no longer take precedence. Instead, the right to life must become the supreme principle. Plural sovereignty may emerge, and a Court of Sovereign Override is envisioned as a constitutional mechanism to override sovereignty when the right to life is at stake. This court would deal exclusively with political murder.

It will redefine the balance between human rights and sovereignty. While general human rights issues remain subject to national sovereignty, the right to life will be elevated above it. The court’s trials and executions will override sovereignty entirely, reshaping the existing order. 

This is not a temporary measure but a permanent shift—establishing a court above sovereignty itself, solely for the protection of the right to life. This legal framework may find its initial success in China and has the potential for broader international application, offering a solution to political murder regimes worldwide.
